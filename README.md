# authenticationWithReactRouter


This project shows how to handle **authentication** in a React app using React Router v6.4+.

Youâ€™ll find examples of:

- Logging in/out with **tokens stored in localStorage**  
- Using **expiration times** for automatic logout  
- **Updating the UI** depending on whether the user is logged in  
- Protecting routes so only authenticated users can access them  
- Working with **query parameters** for login/signup modes  
- Validating user input and showing error messages
